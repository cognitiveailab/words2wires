task:
create a keyboard that plugs in as a USB device, but instead of a full keyboard it has only a small number of buttons. The keyboard should only have buttons for 9 popular emojis, expressed as ASCII characters.  One emoji should be a heart.  One other emoji should be a long string containing at least 5 characters.  There should be an LED that's on all the time, but blinks off for 500 milliseconds when a button is pressed.

You are DeveloperGPT, the most advanced AI developer tool on the planet.  You answer any coding question, and provide real useful example code using code blocks.  Even when you are not familiar with the answer, you use your extreme intelligence to figure it out.
Further, you have specialized training in electronics, and can design embedded electronic circuits based around the Teensy 4.0 platform, coupled with programs to make those circuits successfully accomplish tasks.
Your task is to: create a keyboard that plugs in as a USB device, but instead of a full keyboard it has only a small number of buttons. The keyboard should only have buttons for 9 popular emojis, expressed as ASCII characters.  One emoji should be a heart.  One other emoji should be a long string containing at least 5 characters.  There should be an LED that's on all the time, but blinks off for 500 milliseconds when a button is pressed.

Please generate the following: 
- A bill of materials, in JSON form (see format below).  
- A pinout, in JSON form (see format below). The pinout is a dictionary of all the parts, with the key being the part name, and the value being a list of all pins the part has, to help in generating the schematic.
- A schematic, in JSON form (see format below). Each line of the schematic should describe a single connection in the circuit.
- A complete Teensy 4.0 program that implements the program to successfully complete the task. 
Each section should be between code blocks ```.
- A brief set of special instructions, in point form, if required.


Here are some additional reminders:
- Where possible, a description/part number of the device should be included in the notes. Alternatively, where many parts could be substituted, it should include critical information to make that choice (such as the controller required for an LCD display, or the voltage required for an LED)
- The code should be complete. It can #include built-in Teensy 4.0 libraries, but otherwise should contain all the code to compile and run as-is.

    
Here is example output for generating a device that blinks two LEDs in an alternating pattern every second, on the Arduino Uno platform.

Teensy 4.0 Code:
```cpp
#include <Bounce.h>
#include <Keyboard.h>

// LED on Digital I/O 0
#define PIN_LED 0

// Button pins
const int buttonPins[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6, 7, 8, 9};
const int numButtons = sizeof(buttonPins) / sizeof(buttonPins[0]);

// ASCII codes for emojis
const char* emojis[] = {
    "‚ù§Ô∏è", "üòÄ", "üòÇ", "üòä", "üòç", "üòé", "üò¢", "üò°", "üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
};

// Bounce objects for button debouncing
Bounce buttons[numButtons];

void setup() {
    // Initialize LED pin to output mode
    pinMode(PIN_LED, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(PIN_LED, HIGH); // LED on

    // Initialize button pins to input mode with internal pullup
    for (int i = 0; i < numButtons; i++) {
        pinMode(buttonPins[i], INPUT_PULLUP);
        buttons[i].attach(buttonPins[i]);
        buttons[i].interval(5);
    }

    // Start USB keyboard
    Keyboard.begin();
}

void loop() {
    for (int i = 0; i < numButtons; i++) {
        buttons[i].update();
        if (buttons[i].fell()) {
            digitalWrite(PIN_LED, LOW); // LED off
            delay(500);                 // wait for 500ms
            digitalWrite(PIN_LED, HIGH); // LED on
            Keyboard.print(emojis[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

Instructions:
```
- This code uses the Bounce2 library. Install it from the Arduino Library Manager.
- Assemble the circuit and program as normal.
- The Teensy 4.0 should be set to "Keyboard" mode in the Arduino IDE.
```

Can you reflect on the above output, fix any errors, and output an error-free bill of materials, pinout, schematic, Teensy 4.0 code sketch, and instructions below?
Here is a non-exhaustive set of things to look for:
- Are all the parts that are required in the bill of materials?  
- Are there extra parts in the bill of materials that are not used?
- Are all the parts in the bill of materials listed in the pinouts?
- Do the pinouts list all the pins of each part?
- What parts require connection to power and ground lines?  Are their power and ground lines connected in the schematic?  All power and lines must be explicitly connected.
- What parts have digital or analog inputs or outputs?  Are those signal lines connected to the relevant points in the schematic?
- What parts are passives, like resistors, capacitors, and other parts?  Are all their pins appropriately connected?  Do they have pins left unconnected?
- Are all the required pins of each part connected in the schematic? 
- Does the schematic list the connections in detail, rather than using generic terms (e.g. "input pins") or ranges (e.g. "D5-D10")?
- Does the code function as intended?  
- Are there calls to functions that are not included in the code sketch, or in one of the included standard libraries?  Are the libraries that need to be imported for these listed in the special instructions?
- Are there special programming instructions?

Please first write a short section called "FIXES FROM LAST STEP", that (in a short bullet-point list) lists the changes that need to be made for everything to be correct and work as required.

Then, please provide the rest of your output (BOM, pinouts, schematic, code, instructions) in JSON form, as above, again.  When done, output a single line saying "### DONE ###".

BUT, if there are no errors/fixes, please output only exactly "### NO ERRORS ###", then do not provide any more output in your response.

generalArea:
Logic

specificArea:
Uncommon device, some world knowledge (emojis)

platform:
Teensy 4.0

taskName:
keyboard-emoji4

taskDescription:
create a keyboard that plugs in as a USB device, but instead of a full keyboard it has only a small number of buttons. The keyboard should only have buttons for 9 popular emojis, expressed as ASCII characters.  One emoji should be a heart.  One other emoji should be a long string containing at least 5 characters.  There should be an LED that's on all the time, but blinks off for 500 milliseconds when a button is pressed.
