You are DeveloperGPT, the most advanced AI developer tool on the planet.  You answer any coding question, and provide real useful example code using code blocks.  Even when you are not familiar with the answer, you use your extreme intelligence to figure it out.
Further, you have specialized training in electronics, and can design embedded electronic circuits based around the Adafruit Huzzah32 ESP32 Feather platform, coupled with programs to make those circuits successfully accomplish tasks.
Your task is to: glasses for the blind that provide a helpful sound that corresponds to how close something is in front of them.  Should have a slide switch that can disable the sound.  Please use the MaxSonar ultrasonic distance sensor.

Please generate the following: 
- A bill of materials, in JSON form (see format below).  
- A pinout, in JSON form (see format below). The pinout is a dictionary of all the parts, with the key being the part name, and the value being a list of all pins the part has, to help in generating the schematic.
- A schematic, in JSON form (see format below). Each line of the schematic should describe a single connection in the circuit.
- A complete Adafruit Huzzah32 ESP32 Feather program that implements the program to successfully complete the task. 
Each section should be between code blocks ```.
- A brief set of special instructions, in point form, if required.


Here are some additional reminders:
- Where possible, a description/part number of the device should be included in the notes. Alternatively, where many parts could be substituted, it should include critical information to make that choice (such as the controller required for an LCD display, or the voltage required for an LED)
- The code should be complete. It can #include built-in Adafruit Huzzah32 ESP32 Feather libraries, but otherwise should contain all the code to compile and run as-is.

Adafruit Huzzah32 ESP32 Feather Code:
```
// Ultrasonic glasses 
// This program interfaces with an ultrasonic distance sensor and buzzer to provide audio feedback 
// on the distance of objects in front of the user. A slide switch is used to enable/disable the buzzer.

// Define pins
#define TRIG_PIN 5     // Trigger pin of ultrasonic sensor
#define ECHO_PIN 6     // Echo pin of ultrasonic sensor
#define BUZZ_PIN 25    // Buzzer pin 
#define SW_PIN 23      // Slide switch pin

// Define variables 
long duration;        // Duration of pulse from echo 
int distance;         // Distance in cm

void setup() {
  // Set pins as outputs and inputs
  pinMode(TRIG_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ECHO_PIN, INPUT);
  pinMode(BUZZ_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(SW_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP);
  
  // Begin serial communication 
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // Check if switch is closed (connected to 3V)
  if (digitalRead(SW_PIN) == LOW) {
    
    // Send 10us pulse to trigger
    digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, HIGH);
    delayMicroseconds(10);
    digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW);
    
    // Measure duration of pulse from echo
    duration = pulseIn(ECHO_PIN, HIGH);
    
    // Calculate distance 
    distance = duration*0.034/2;
    
    // Output distance to serial monitor
    Serial.print("Distance: ");
    Serial.print(distance);
    Serial.println(" cm");
    
    // Play tone corresponding to distance
    if (distance <= 10) {
      tone(BUZZ_PIN, 1000);  // Closest - fast beeping
    } else if (distance <= 20) {
      tone(BUZZ_PIN, 500);   // Medium distance - medium beeping 
    } else if (distance <= 30) {
      tone(BUZZ_PIN, 250);   // Far distance - slow beeping
    } else {
      noTone(BUZZ_PIN);     // No tone if object out of range
    }
  } else {
    // Switch is open, disable buzzer
    noTone(BUZZ_PIN);
  }
}
```

Instructions:
- Assemble circuit and upload code to ESP32 Feather as per instructions
- The buzzer will play a tone corresponding to the distance of objects in front of the sensor, to provide audio feedback to the user. 
- The slide switch can be used to enable/disable the buzzer.

Can you reflect on the above output, fix any errors, and output an error-free bill of materials, pinout, schematic, Adafruit Huzzah32 ESP32 Feather code sketch, and instructions below?
Here is a non-exhaustive set of things to look for:
- Are all the parts that are required in the bill of materials?  
- Are there extra parts in the bill of materials that are not used?
- Are all the parts in the bill of materials listed in the pinouts?
- Do the pinouts list all the pins of each part?
- What parts require connection to power and ground lines?  Are their power and ground lines connected in the schematic?  All power and lines must be explicitly connected.
- What parts have digital or analog inputs or outputs?  Are those signal lines connected to the relevant points in the schematic?
- What parts are passives, like resistors, capacitors, and other parts?  Are all their pins appropriately connected?  Do they have pins left unconnected?
- Are all the required pins of each part connected in the schematic? 
- Does the schematic list the connections in detail, rather than using generic terms (e.g. "input pins") or ranges (e.g. "D5-D10")?
- Does the code function as intended?  
- Are there calls to functions that are not included in the code sketch, or in one of the included standard libraries?  Are the libraries that need to be imported for these listed in the special instructions?
- Are there special programming instructions?

Please first write a short section called "FIXES FROM LAST STEP", that (in a short bullet-point list) lists the changes that need to be made for everything to be correct and work as required.

Then, please provide the rest of your output (BOM, pinouts, schematic, code, instructions) in JSON form, as above, again.  When done, output a single line saying "### DONE ###".

BUT, if there are no errors/fixes, please output only exactly "### NO ERRORS ###", then do not provide any more output in your response.
