task:
create a keyboard that plugs in as a USB device, but instead of a full keyboard it has only a small number of buttons. The keyboard should only have buttons for the first prime numbers up to the number 20. Each prime number should have it's own button.

You are DeveloperGPT, the most advanced AI developer tool on the planet.  You answer any coding question, and provide real useful example code using code blocks.  Even when you are not familiar with the answer, you use your extreme intelligence to figure it out.
Further, you have specialized training in electronics, and can design embedded electronic circuits based around the Teensy 4.0 platform, coupled with programs to make those circuits successfully accomplish tasks.
Your task is to: create a keyboard that plugs in as a USB device, but instead of a full keyboard it has only a small number of buttons. The keyboard should only have buttons for the first prime numbers up to the number 20. Each prime number should have it's own button.

Please generate the following: 
- A bill of materials, in JSON form (see format below).  
- A pinout, in JSON form (see format below). The pinout is a dictionary of all the parts, with the key being the part name, and the value being a list of all pins the part has, to help in generating the schematic.
- A schematic, in JSON form (see format below). Each line of the schematic should describe a single connection in the circuit.
- A complete Teensy 4.0 program that implements the program to successfully complete the task. 
Each section should be between code blocks ```.
- A brief set of special instructions, in point form, if required.


Here are some additional reminders:
- Where possible, a description/part number of the device should be included in the notes. Alternatively, where many parts could be substituted, it should include critical information to make that choice (such as the controller required for an LCD display, or the voltage required for an LED)
- The code should be complete. It can #include built-in Teensy 4.0 libraries, but otherwise should contain all the code to compile and run as-is.

Please generate the bill of materials, pinouts, schematic, code, and any special instructions for the requested task below.  The code should be commented, to help follow the logic, and prevent any bugs.The platform is: Teensy 4.0.
The task is: create a keyboard that plugs in as a USB device, but instead of a full keyboard it has only a small number of buttons. The keyboard should only have buttons for the first prime numbers up to the number 20. Each prime number should have it's own button..

Teensy 4.0 Code:
```
// Prime number keyboard
// This code interfaces with a circuit that has buttons for the first 8 prime numbers. 
// It prints the number of the button pressed to the serial monitor.

// Button pins
#define PIN_BT1 0   // Button for 2
#define PIN_BT2 1   // Button for 3
#define PIN_BT3 2   // Button for 5 
#define PIN_BT4 3   // Button for 7
#define PIN_BT5 4   // Button for 11
#define PIN_BT6 5   // Button for 13
#define PIN_BT7 6   // Button for 17
#define PIN_BT8 7   // Button for 19

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
    // Initialize button pins to input mode and enable pull-up resistors
    pinMode(PIN_BT1, INPUT_PULLUP);
    pinMode(PIN_BT2, INPUT_PULLUP);
    pinMode(PIN_BT3, INPUT_PULLUP);
    pinMode(PIN_BT4, INPUT_PULLUP);
    pinMode(PIN_BT5, INPUT_PULLUP);
    pinMode(PIN_BT6, INPUT_PULLUP);
    pinMode(PIN_BT7, INPUT_PULLUP);
    pinMode(PIN_BT8, INPUT_PULLUP);
    
    // Start serial communication
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
    // Check if BT1 (2) is pressed and print message if it is
    if (digitalRead(PIN_BT1) == LOW) { 
        Serial.println("2");
    }
    
    // Check if BT2 (3) is pressed and print message if it is
    if (digitalRead(PIN_BT2) == LOW) { 
        Serial.println("3");
    }
    
    // Check remaining buttons and print associated prime number if pressed
    
    // Add delay to prevent button presses too close together from registering twice
    delay(200); 
}
```

Instructions:
```
- This code uses only standard libraries. No additional libraries are required.
- Assemble circuit and program Teensy 4.0 as normal. 
- Open the serial monitor at 9600 baud to view the prime numbers printed when buttons are pressed.
```

Can you reflect on the above output, fix any errors, and output an error-free bill of materials, pinout, schematic, Teensy 4.0 code sketch, and instructions below?
Here is a non-exhaustive set of things to look for:
- Are all the parts that are required in the bill of materials?  
- Are there extra parts in the bill of materials that are not used?
- Are all the parts in the bill of materials listed in the pinouts?
- Do the pinouts list all the pins of each part?
- What parts require connection to power and ground lines?  Are their power and ground lines connected in the schematic?  All power and lines must be explicitly connected.
- What parts have digital or analog inputs or outputs?  Are those signal lines connected to the relevant points in the schematic?
- What parts are passives, like resistors, capacitors, and other parts?  Are all their pins appropriately connected?  Do they have pins left unconnected?
- Are all the required pins of each part connected in the schematic? 
- Does the schematic list the connections in detail, rather than using generic terms (e.g. "input pins") or ranges (e.g. "D5-D10")?
- Does the code function as intended?  
- Are there calls to functions that are not included in the code sketch, or in one of the included standard libraries?  Are the libraries that need to be imported for these listed in the special instructions?
- Are there special programming instructions?

Please first write a short section called "FIXES FROM LAST STEP", that (in a short bullet-point list) lists the changes that need to be made for everything to be correct and work as required.

Then, please provide the rest of your output (BOM, pinouts, schematic, code, instructions) in JSON form, as above, again.  When done, output a single line saying "### DONE ###".

BUT, if there are no errors/fixes, please output only exactly "### NO ERRORS ###", then do not provide any more output in your response.
