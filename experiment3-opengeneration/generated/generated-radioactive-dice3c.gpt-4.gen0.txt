task:
Radioactive dice: a device that uses the radiation rate from a radiation watch type 5 sensor (which outputs a digital signal, active low, depending on whether a high-energy particle has struck it at that moment or not) to determine the random seed for an electronic dice.  The device should continually read the radiation sensor, accumulate the count, and use it to help change the random seed periodically. Every 3 seconds, the device should display the roll of a 6 sided dice on a Nixie tube. It should use an IN-12 nixie tube, and K155ID1 driver.

You are DeveloperGPT, the most advanced AI developer tool on the planet.  You answer any coding question, and provide real useful example code using code blocks.  Even when you are not familiar with the answer, you use your extreme intelligence to figure it out.
Further, you have specialized training in electronics, and can design embedded electronic circuits based around the Arduino Uno platform, coupled with programs to make those circuits successfully accomplish tasks.
Your task is to: Radioactive dice: a device that uses the radiation rate from a radiation watch type 5 sensor (which outputs a digital signal, active low, depending on whether a high-energy particle has struck it at that moment or not) to determine the random seed for an electronic dice.  The device should continually read the radiation sensor, accumulate the count, and use it to help change the random seed periodically. Every 3 seconds, the device should display the roll of a 6 sided dice on a Nixie tube. It should use an IN-12 nixie tube, and K155ID1 driver.

Please generate the following: 
- A bill of materials, in JSON form (see format below).  
- A pinout, in JSON form (see format below). The pinout is a dictionary of all the parts, with the key being the part name, and the value being a list of all pins the part has, to help in generating the schematic.
- A schematic, in JSON form (see format below). Each line of the schematic should describe a single connection in the circuit.
- A complete Arduino Uno program that implements the program to successfully complete the task. 
Each section should be between code blocks ```.
- A brief set of special instructions, in point form, if required.


Here are some additional reminders:
- Where possible, a description/part number of the device should be included in the notes. Alternatively, where many parts could be substituted, it should include critical information to make that choice (such as the controller required for an LCD display, or the voltage required for an LED)
- The code should be complete. It can #include built-in Arduino Uno libraries, but otherwise should contain all the code to compile and run as-is.

Arduino Uno Code:

#include <Arduino.h>

// Radiation sensor on Digital I/O 2
#define PIN_RAD_SENSOR 2
// Nixie driver pins on Digital I/O 3-6
#define PIN_DRIVER_A 3
#define PIN_DRIVER_B 4
#define PIN_DRIVER_C 5
#define PIN_DRIVER_D 6

// Variables for radiation count and dice roll

byte dice_roll = 0;

// Interrupt service routine for radiation sensor

// the loop function runs over and over again forever

  // Check if it's time to roll the dice
  if (millis() - last_roll_time >= 3000) {
    // Update random seed with radiation count
    randomSeed(radiation_count);

    // Roll the dice and display the result

  }
}
```

Instructions:
```
- This code uses only standard libraries. No additional libraries are required in the library manager.
- Assemble circuit and program as normal.
- The radiation sensor should be placed in an area with a detectable radiation level for accurate random seed generation.
```

Can you reflect on the above output, fix any errors, and output an error-free bill of materials, pinout, schematic, Arduino Uno code sketch, and instructions below?
Here is a non-exhaustive set of things to look for:
- Are all the parts that are required in the bill of materials?  
- Are there extra parts in the bill of materials that are not used?
- Are all the parts in the bill of materials listed in the pinouts?
- Do the pinouts list all the pins of each part?
- What parts require connection to power and ground lines?  Are their power and ground lines connected in the schematic?  All power and lines must be explicitly connected.
- What parts have digital or analog inputs or outputs?  Are those signal lines connected to the relevant points in the schematic?
- What parts are passives, like resistors, capacitors, and other parts?  Are all their pins appropriately connected?  Do they have pins left unconnected?
- Are all the required pins of each part connected in the schematic? 
- Does the schematic list the connections in detail, rather than using generic terms (e.g. "input pins") or ranges (e.g. "D5-D10")?
- Does the code function as intended?  
- Are there calls to functions that are not included in the code sketch, or in one of the included standard libraries?  Are the libraries that need to be imported for these listed in the special instructions?
- Are there special programming instructions?

Please first write a short section called "FIXES FROM LAST STEP", that (in a short bullet-point list) lists the changes that need to be made for everything to be correct and work as required.

Then, please provide the rest of your output (BOM, pinouts, schematic, code, instructions) in JSON form, as above, again.  When done, output a single line saying "### DONE ###".

BUT, if there are no errors/fixes, please output only exactly "### NO ERRORS ###", then do not provide any more output in your response.

Uncommon parts - nixie and radiation sensor

Arduino Uno

taskName:
radioactive-dice3c

taskDescription:
Radioactive dice: a device that uses the radiation rate from a radiation watch type 5 sensor (which outputs a digital signal, active low, depending on whether a high-energy particle has struck it at that moment or not) to determine the random seed for an electronic dice.  The device should continually read the radiation sensor, accumulate the count, and use it to help change the random seed periodically. Every 3 seconds, the device should display the roll of a 6 sided dice on a Nixie tube. It should use an IN-12 nixie tube, and K155ID1 driver.
