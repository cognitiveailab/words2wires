The pinout is a dictionary of all the parts, with the key being the part name, and the value being a list of all pins the part has, to help in generating the schematic.\n- A schematic, in JSON form (see format below). Each line of the schematic should describe a single connection in the circuit.\n- A complete Teensy 4.0 program that implements the program to successfully complete the task. \nEach section should be between code blocks ```.\n- A brief set of special instructions, in point form, if required.\n\n\nHere are some additional reminders:\n- Where possible, a description/part number of the device should be included in the notes. Alternatively, where many parts could be substituted, it should include critical information to make that choice (such as the controller required for an LCD display, or the voltage required for an LED)\n- The code should be complete.

Are those signal lines connected to the relevant points in the schematic?\n- What parts are passives, like resistors, capacitors, and other parts?  Are all their pins appropriately connected?  Do they have pins left unconnected?\n- Are all the required pins of each part connected in the schematic? \n- Does the schematic list the connections in detail, rather than using generic terms (e.g. \"input pins\") or ranges (e.g. \"D5-D10\")?\n- Does the code function as intended?  \n- Are there calls to functions that are not included in the code sketch, or in one of the included standard libraries?  Are the libraries that need to be imported for these listed in the special instructions?\n- Are there special programming instructions?\n\nPlease first write a short section called \"FIXES FROM LAST STEP\", that (in a short bullet-point list) lists the changes that need to be made for everything to be correct and work as required.\n\nThen, please provide the rest of your output (BOM, pinouts, schematic, code, instructions) in JSON form, as above, again.
