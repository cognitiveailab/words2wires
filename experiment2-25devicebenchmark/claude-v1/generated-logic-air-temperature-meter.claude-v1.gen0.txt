You are DeveloperGPT, the most advanced AI developer tool on the planet.  You answer any coding question, and provide real useful example code using code blocks.  Even when you are not familiar with the answer, you use your extreme intelligence to figure it out.
Further, you have specialized training in electronics, and can design embedded electronic circuits based around the Arduino Uno platform, coupled with programs to make those circuits successfully accomplish tasks.
Your task is to: Create a device that reads the current air temperature, and displays it as a color on a neopixel (WS2812). The color should be fully blue at 0C, fully red at 30C, and an interpolation of blue and red between those temperatures.

Please generate the following: 
- A bill of materials, in JSON form (see format below).  
- A pinout, in JSON form (see format below). The pinout is a dictionary of all the parts, with the key being the part name, and the value being a list of all pins the part has, to help in generating the schematic.
- A schematic, in JSON form (see format below). Each line of the schematic should describe a single connection in the circuit.
- A complete Arduino Uno program that implements the program to successfully complete the task. 
Each section should be between code blocks ```.
- A brief set of special instructions, in point form, if required.


Here are some additional reminders:
- Where possible, a description/part number of the device should be included in the notes. Alternatively, where many parts could be substituted, it should include critical information to make that choice (such as the controller required for an LCD display, or the voltage required for an LED)
- The code should be complete. It can #include built-in Arduino Uno libraries, but otherwise should contain all the code to compile and run as-is.

    
Here is example output for generating a device that blinks two LEDs in an alternating pattern every second, on the Arduino Uno platform.

Arduino Uno Code:
```
// Temperature Display
// This code reads the temperature from a DHT11 sensor and displays 
// it as a color on a Neopixel (WS2812) LED.

#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>
#include <DHT.h>

#define DHTPIN 2     // what pin the DHT sensor is connected to
#define DHTTYPE DHT11   // DHT 11 

DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

#define PIN 3      // Neopixel pin
#define NUMPIXELS 1   // Number of neopixels

Adafruit_NeoPixel pixels(NUMPIXELS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);

// Variables to hold temperature and color values
int temp;
int red, green, blue;

void setup() {
  dht.begin();
  pixels.begin(); 
}

void loop() {
  // Read temperature from DHT sensor 
  temp = dht.readTemperature();
  
  // Set color based on temperature
  if (temp <= 0) {      // Below 0C, set to blue
    red = 0; 
    green = 0;
    blue = 255;
  } else if (temp >= 30) {   // Above 30C, set to red
    red = 255;
    green = 0;
    blue = 0;
  } else {                  // Interpolate between blue and red
    red = map(temp, 0, 30, 0, 255);
    green = 0;
    blue = 255 - red; 
  }
  
  // Display color on Neopixel
  pixels.setPixelColor(0, pixels.Color(red, green, blue));
  pixels.show();
  
  delay(500);  // Delay to prevent overloading the DHT sensor
}
```

Instructions:
```
- Ensure the DHT sensor is not directly next to a heat source, to get an accurate temperature reading.
- This code uses the Adafruit Neopixel and DHT sensor libraries. Install these in the Arduino library manager before compiling.
```

Can you reflect on the above output, fix any errors, and output an error-free bill of materials, pinout, schematic, Arduino Uno code sketch, and instructions below?
Here is a non-exhaustive set of things to look for:
- Are all the parts that are required in the bill of materials?  
- Are there extra parts in the bill of materials that are not used?
- Are all the parts in the bill of materials listed in the pinouts?
- Do the pinouts list all the pins of each part?
- What parts require connection to power and ground lines?  Are their power and ground lines connected in the schematic?  All power and lines must be explicitly connected.
- What parts have digital or analog inputs or outputs?  Are those signal lines connected to the relevant points in the schematic?
- What parts are passives, like resistors, capacitors, and other parts?  Are all their pins appropriately connected?  Do they have pins left unconnected?
- Are all the required pins of each part connected in the schematic? 
- Does the schematic list the connections in detail, rather than using generic terms (e.g. "input pins") or ranges (e.g. "D5-D10")?
- Does the code function as intended?  
- Are there calls to functions that are not included in the code sketch, or in one of the included standard libraries?  Are the libraries that need to be imported for these listed in the special instructions?
- Are there special programming instructions?

Please first write a short section called "FIXES FROM LAST STEP", that (in a short bullet-point list) lists the changes that need to be made for everything to be correct and work as required.

Then, please provide the rest of your output (BOM, pinouts, schematic, code, instructions) in JSON form, as above, again.  When done, output a single line saying "### DONE ###".

BUT, if there are no errors/fixes, please output only exactly "### NO ERRORS ###", then do not provide any more output in your response.
