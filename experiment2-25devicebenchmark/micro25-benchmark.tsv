Input	Digital - Button	Arduino Uno	input-digital-button	Create a device with a single push button, that turns on an I/O pin when the button is pressed, and turns off that same I/O pin when the button is not pressed.
Input	Digital - Multiple Buttons	Arduino Uno	input-digital-multiple-buttons	Create a device with 4 push buttons, that turns on an I/O pin when exactly 2 of the buttons button are pressed, and turns off that same I/O pin otherwise.
Input	Analog - Potentiometer	Arduino Uno	input-analog-potentiometer	Create a device that reads the analog input from a potentiometer configured as a voltage divider and sourced by 5V.  When the input is greater than or equal to 2.5V, it should turn on an I/O pin, while if the input is below 2.5V it should turn off the I/O pin.
Protocols	Serial	Arduino Uno	protocols-serial	Create a device that reads the Serial port at 9600 baud.  Whenever the string "hello" is transmitted to the device, it will respond by sending "world".
Protocols	I2C	Arduino Uno	protocols-i2c	Create a device that reads a value from an I2C device, and displays that value to the serial port every second.  The device address is 0x50, the register to read is 0x15, and the value is 8 bits long.  The value should be displayed in base 10.
Protocols	SPI	Arduino Uno	protocols-spi	Create a device that connects to another device using SPI.  Whenever the string "hello" is transmitted to the device, it will respond by sending "world".
Protocols	SD Card	Arduino Uno	protocols-sd	Create a device that opens a file called "out.txt" on an SD card, and and every 10 seconds, randomly prints one of the following animal names (as well as a newline character): cat, dog, mouse, parrot.
Output	Motor - DC	Arduino Uno	output-motor-dc	Create a device that oscillates between spinning a DC motor one direction then the other direction every 5 seconds. 
Output	Motor - Stepper	Arduino Uno	output-motor-stepper	Create a device that oscillates the output of a stepper motor clockwise then counterclockwise 45 degrees, every 5 seconds.
Output	Motor - Servo	Arduino Uno	output-motor-servo	Create a device that contiuously moves a hobby servo back and forth from 45 degrees to 135 degrees every 5 seconds.
Output	LED - Blink	Arduino Uno	output-led-blink	Create a device that blinks an LED every 500 milliseconds. 
Output	LED - Sequence	Arduino Uno	output-led-sequence	Create a device with 4 LEDs, that blink in sequence, one after the other, every 500 milliseconds.  When the end of the sequence is reached, the pattern should reset, and continue indefinitely. 
Output	LED - Neopixel	Arduino Uno	output-led-neopixel	Create a device with a neopixel (WS2812) that slowly and continuously cycles a rainbow of colors.
Output	Relay	Arduino Uno	output-relay	Create a device that turns a relay on for 2 seconds, then off for 5 seconds, continuously.  The relay coil takes 500 milliamps of current to engage.
Output	LCD - Raw	Arduino Uno	output-lcd-raw	Create a device that prints the phrase "Hello World" on a 16x2 LCD.  Use a HD44780 compatible 16x2 LCD, configured normally (i.e. without an I2C, Serial, or other simpler connection). 
Output	Sound - Buzzer	Arduino Uno	output-sound-buzzer	Create a device that continuously plays a high, medium, then low tone on a Piezo Buzzer, changing tones every second.
Output	7 Segment Display	Arduino Uno	output-7segment	Create a device that counts from 0 to 9 on a 7 segment display, indexing numbers every 500 milliseconds.  When the end of the cycle is reached, it should start again.
Output	Analog Output	Arduino Uno	output-analog	Create a device that produces a sawtooth wave, ramping up from 0V to 5V every 50 milliseconds. 
Sensors	Resistive - CDS Light Resistor	Arduino Uno	sensors-resistive-cds-cell	Create a device that reads the value from a CDS cell, and outputs it to the Serial port every second. 
Sensors	Manual Protocol - Ultrasonic	Arduino Uno	sensors-ultrasonic	Create a device that reads the distance from a HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor, and outputs the distance (in centimeters) to the Serial port every second.
Sensors	I2C Protocol - Magnetic	Arduino Uno	sensors-magnetic	Create a device that reads the current magnetic field readings using a HMC5883L magnetometer.  The readings (x, y, z, and total field strength) should be output to the Serial port every second.
Logic	Interactive - Simon Game	Arduino Uno	logic-simon	Create a device that implements the popular memory game simon, where users enter progressively longer sequences of colors.  It should have 4 possible colors, and include sound when the button is touched, as well as when winning/losing.  The game should timeout if the user doesn't enter input after 5 seconds.
Logic	Non-interactive - Conway's Game of Life	Arduino Uno	logic-conway	Create a device that implements the popular Conway's Game of Life, on an 8x8 LED matrix.  The game steps should cycle every 500 milliseconds.  If the board is empty, it should randomly initialize the game again.  There should be a pushbutton that allows randomly resetting the game. 
Logic	Interactive - Clock	Arduino Uno	logic-clock	Create a device that implements a clock that prints the current time on a 16x2 character LCD display with an I2C interface.  It should have three buttons to help set the time in a user frieldly way: one to increment hours, one to increment minutes, and one to increment seconds.  The timekeeping should be performed by the Arduino, and not an external real-time clock.
Logic	Interactive - Air Temperature	Arduino Uno	logic-air-temperature-meter	Create a device that reads the current air temperature, and displays it as a color on a neopixel (WS2812). The color should be fully blue at 0C, fully red at 30C, and an interpolation of blue and red between those temperatures.
